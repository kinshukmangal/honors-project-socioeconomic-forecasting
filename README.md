# ðŸ“Š Honors Project â€“ Socio-Economic Forecasting Using Time Series Analysis

This repository contains my MATH 489 Honors Project submitted at Western Illinois University in Spring 2025. The research focuses on building predictive models for key socio-economic indicators using both regularized regression and multivariate time series modeling across five major global economies.

## ðŸ“˜ Title

**Time Series Analysis and Optimization of Socio-Economic Indicators Across Global Economies**

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview

The study targets four critical indicators:
- **Gini Index** (inequality)
- **GDP per Capita**
- **Unemployment Rate**
- **Education Expenditure (% of GDP)**

across five diverse countries: India, Brazil, Nigeria, USA, and China (1980â€“2023).

---

## ðŸ“Š Methodology Highlights

- **Exploratory Data Analysis** & Pearson correlation
- **LASSO Regression** for high-dimensional feature selection
- **BIC Optimization** for model parsimony
- **Vector Autoregression (VAR)** for multi-variable time series forecasting
- **Diagnostic Testing**: ADF test, Ljung-Box, Jarque-Bera, Heteroskedasticity
- **Forecasts** to 2040 with confidence intervals and impulse response functions (IRFs)

---

## ðŸ”¬ Key Insights

- **Lasso + BIC** improves interpretability by favoring structural development indicators over macroeconomic volume
- VAR modeling captures interdependence between inequality, education, GDP, and jobs
- Some long-term forecasts (e.g., India GDP) reveal the limitations of unrestricted time series methods
- Life expectancy emerged as a universally important predictor across all models

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization Features

- Rolling 3-year Gini trends (global comparison)
- Impulse Response Functions (IRFs) by country
- Forecasts with 95% confidence intervals up to 2040
